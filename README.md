# Angular Text Count App

A standalone Angular demo app that dynamically counts numbers and replaces them with text when divisible by given values — similar to “FizzBuzz” but fully configurable. The project also demonstrates loading data via an HTTP service and rendering nested loops. Contains headless testing.
